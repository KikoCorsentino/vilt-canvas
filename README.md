## About This Project

This is a Laravel 12 application with Inertia.js 2, Vue 3, Tailwind CSS 4, and Laravel Wayfinder for enhanced routing.

### Key Features

- **Inertia.js 2** - Modern monolith approach with Vue 3 Composition API
- **Vue 3** - Progressive JavaScript framework with Composition API
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first CSS framework with oklch color system
- **Laravel Wayfinder** - Type-safe routing between Laravel and TypeScript
- **Laravel Fortify** - Headless authentication backend
- **Pest** - Modern PHP testing framework

### Wayfinder Integration

This project uses [Laravel Wayfinder](https://github.com/laravel/wayfinder) to generate type-safe route helpers for use in Vue components. Routes are automatically generated and can be imported from `@/routes`:

```vue
<script setup>
import { welcome, login, register } from '@/routes';
import { Link } from '@inertiajs/vue3';
</script>

<template>
  <Link :href="login.url()">Login</Link>
  <Link :href="register.url()">Register</Link>
</template>
```

To regenerate routes after adding new routes or controllers:

```bash
php artisan wayfinder:generate
```

The Wayfinder Vite plugin automatically watches for changes during development and regenerates routes on build.

**Note:** The `wayfinder`, `actions`, and `routes` directories in `resources/js` are auto-generated and can be safely added to `.gitignore`.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
